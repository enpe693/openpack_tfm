# OpenPack Challenge: Master Thesis

This is the repository for my contribution to the [Open Pack Challenge 2022](https://open-pack.github.io/challenge2022/), developed as a Master Degree's Thesis. The OpenPack Challenge 2022 was a Human Activity Recognition challenge, in which the participants developped a model that had to recognize the different operations performed by a number of workers in a logistic center, such as picking up a box, store item inside a box... for a total of 10 different activity classes

Data from the operations was available coming from several sources, but in this project only IMU, keypoints and E4 were the ones used.
