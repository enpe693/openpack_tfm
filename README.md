# OpenPack Challenge: Master Thesis

This is the repository for my contribution to the [Open Pack Challenge 2022](https://open-pack.github.io/challenge2022/), developed as a Master Degree's Thesis. The OpenPack Challenge 2022 was a Human Activity Recognition challenge, in which the participants developped a model that had to recognize the different operations performed by a number of workers in a logistic center, such as picking up a box, store item inside a box... for a total of 10 different activity classes

Data from the operations was available coming from several sources, but in this project only IMU, keypoints and E4 were the ones used. 

The project was developed based on the examples found in [OpenPack Torch](https://github.com/open-pack/openpack-torch/tree/main) and [OpenPack Toolkit](https://github.com/open-pack/openpack-toolkit/tree/70652b83739ba9d44aff197996fc62886c5d9772). The code there was changed to test the performance of both new models and a new data loader, but keeping the basic structure provided by the organization.
